**VIP Business Jet – Conceptual Aircraft Design**
**Overview**

Conceptual design of a midsize VIP jet under transport-category performance constraints. The project followed a structured sizing approach beginning with mission definition, followed by constraint-based performance analysis, iterative refinement of wing loading and thrust-to-weight parameters, and integration of propulsion, fuel storage, and cabin layout considerations.

Initial performance estimates produced excessive takeoff field length (>10,000 ft). Iterative refinement of W/S and T/W selections reduced runway requirements while maintaining cruise efficiency and mission range targets.


**My Contributions and Engineering Process**
**1. Mission Definition**

Established aircraft role and competitive range targets
Developed mission profile and key performance requirements

**2. Constraint-Based Parameter Selection**

Calculated required wing loading (W/S) and thrust-to-weight ratio (T/W) values across multiple mission phases including takeoff, climb, cruise, ceiling, sustained turn, and landing
Organized results to compare competing constraints across flight conditions
Selected final W/S and T/W values that satisfied all mission requirements simultaneously
Iteratively refined selections after initial sizing produced excessive takeoff field length (>10,000 ft)

**3. Propulsion & Fuel System Considerations**

Developed conceptual fuel storage layout utilizing wing integral tanks and supplemental fuselage bladder tanks
Evaluated tradeoffs between fuel capacity and cabin space
Proposed fuel burn sequencing approach to minimize longitudinal CG migration
Included empty space in fuel tanks (~4%) to account for thermal expansion margin

**4. Cabin & Crew Layout**

Developed crew station layout with visibility and operational constraints in mind
Configured passenger cabin consistent with mission and weight objectives

**5. Project Coordination**

Organized team meetings and deliverables
Managed formatting and technical compilation

**Key Technical Insights**

Takeoff field length can dominate early aircraft sizing decisions
Wing loading and thrust-to-weight ratio are strongly coupled in constraint-driven design
Fuel placement significantly affects CG migration and trim drag
Early assumptions propagate heavily into final geometry
